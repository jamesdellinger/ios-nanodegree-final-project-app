# Final Project: "I Can Cook" App

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains the final project app for Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

"I Can Cook" provides a simple, user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and easily accessing all of your
recipes. Think of it as recipe notebook for the smartphone era.

On first-time app launch, a hint graphic shows the user how to add their first recipe:

1. Tapping "Edit" causes the map view to rise up, revealing the red bar underneath. Makes for greater similarity with how "Delete"
    indicators are revealed in other iOS elements, such as table views:

2. Can tap on pin displayed above a location's photo album to reveal a nicely formatted address. If user has already dropped
    several pins, it can be easy to forget which pin's album is being viewed:

3. Finally, it is possible to long press on any cell inside the collection view to display a larger size of a photo. The screen
    displaying this blown-up photo also contains an affordance that allows user to share the photo with any of their friends.
